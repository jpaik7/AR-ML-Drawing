# AR-ML Drawing

iOS application that uses semantic segmentation with deep learning to recognize hand
movements and allows the user to draw in 3D augmented reality in real time. Written in Swift using the iOS CoreML API and ARKit.

The CoreML model used for this project, as well as some anciliary files, have been redacted. If you're interested in reproducing the project on your own, or have more specific questions on the models or files used in this project, reach out to me. I've open sourced the rest of this project for creative (and independent!) use by others.

This project was my midterm project for the class [Creative Applications of Machine Learning](http://courses.channel.studio/spring2019machinelearning/) at [RISD](https://www.risd.edu/).
